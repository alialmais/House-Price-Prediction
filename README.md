# House-Price-Prediction
=======


**Overview:**
This project explores four machine learning models to determine the optimal method for predicting house prices in California. Linear regression was chosen first and considered as a baseline model due to it’s simplicity, decision tree was adopted to identify non-linear relationships in housing data, Random Forest was used to improve generalization, and XGBoost was selected due to it’s performance on structured data.
I used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² Score for evaluating the models.
  RMSE helps in indicating   how much error the model makes. R² Score helps us know how well the model understands house prices. The model with the best performance was XGBoost(Tuned) achieving R² = 0.73.As future work I should focus on improving feature engineering to achieve higher accuracy.
